        I often take my phone with me when I sit during free time, allowing me to play and enahnce my skills in playing. Each game tells a story, and it’s a way to relive the moments long after they’ve passed. Gaming motivates me to keep my life going and the importance of enjoying every step in life, even in the smallest of things.
